          I have recently become very interested in Web Design and now focus on expanding my 
          knowledge of the different languages and technologies that are used. I recently completed 
          Lighthouse Labs Part-Time Course 
          <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/web-part-time">Lighthouse Labs Part-time Course</a>
          in which I learned how to use HTML &#38; CSS, Sinatra, Git/Github, Ruby, and I have become
          more proficient at using the Mac Terminal. Additionally, I have been subscribed to 
          Codeschool <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a> and have used it to learn 
          more about HTML &#38; CSS. My next step that I am looking forward to taking is learning 
          Javascript. While practicing my code, a tool I have been regularly using to solve problems 
          is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>.

          Right now I am employed as a Quality Assurance Tester for Clapfoot Games Inc
          <a href="http://www.clapfootgames.com/">Clapfoot Games Inc</a>. It's a
          rewarding position knowing that I am contributing to upcoming game. We use a testing 
          matrix to test the main controls and for the rest of our day we have to use our keen eye 
          to spot anything that is not functioning properly or anything that breaks the game. After 
          finding any issues with the game we have to retrace our steps to reproduce the issue and 
          record everything we did so that the rest of the team can fix it. To work as a Quality 
          Assurance Tester, you need to be able to think outside the box, have a very keen eye for 
          details, and it certainly helps being as experienced in video games as I am.
